# xG21 DMA SPI Throughput Tester #

## Summary ##

This project calculates the bandwidth achievable when the LDMA is used to read data from a SPI flash memory (effectively,
any device compatible with the now industry-standard command set first implemented on the Numonyx M25P40) with the USART
operating in synchronous mode.

Because this code benchmarks read performance, there is no need to connect an actual SPI flash device to the EFR32xG21.
The timing of read operations is gated by the timing achievable with the USART and the GPIO pins that would otherwise
interface to such a device. These pins are driven as they would be if connected to an actual IC and can be observed on
an oscilloscope.

Modules used: CMU, EMU, GPIO, LDMA, SYSTICK, USART0 (for VCOM), and USART2 (SPI flash).

## Setup ##

Clone the repository with this project from GitHub onto your local machine.

From within the Simplicity Studio IDE, select Import -> MCU Project... from the Project menu. Click the Browse button
and navigate to the local repository folder, then to the SimplicityStudio folder, select the .slsproj file for the
board, click the Next button twice, and then click Finish.

## How the Project Works ##

The code offers a fair degree of configurability, so it is a simple matter to change the amount of data read or,
in particular, the frequency of the USART module clock. The DPLL is used to generate the SYSCLK, which is the top-level
clock from which the HCLK (bus clock) and PCLK (synchronous peripheral clock) are derived, and initialization
structures are present in the code (all but one of which is commented out) to set the DPLL output to 40, 50, and
80 MHz, which results in PCLK frequencies of 40, 50, and 40 MHz, respectively.

After sending the SPI flash read command and the 24-bit address, 1 Mbyte of dummy data is clocked out the TX pin
(which the SPI flash would ignore) while 1 Mbyte of data is clocked in on the RX pin in blocks of 1 Kbyte at a time.
The SYSTICK timer is started and stopped immediately before and after the read sequence, and the difference between
the start and end times is used to calculate bandwidth.

The code flow is as follows:

1.  Initialize the CMU.

This is where the DPLL is configured for the desired SYSCLK frequency. The HFXO is started first, as it is used as the
reference clock for the DPLL.

2.  The SYSTICK timer is configured for 1 ms ticks.

This code includes a set of SYSTICK utility functions in the Drivers/systick.* files that can be useful for other purposes,

3.  stdio functions are retargeted to use USART0 for VCOM.

4.  USART2 is initialized for operation in synchronous mode (initSPI2).

The divider is set for the maximum possible clock frequency (PCLK / 2), and the USART is set to transfer and receive data
MSB first as this is the standard for SPI devices and what any M25P40-compatible flash expects. The clock phase (CLKPHA)
and clock polarity (CLKPOL) are both set to 0, which is often called SPI mode 0, which means that (a) the clock is inactive
low and the master (b) drives data on the leading (rising) edge of the clock and (c) samples data on the falling edge of
the clock.  

Because the delays through the EFR32 GPIO multiplexing logic are relatively long, it is necessary to enable synchronous
master sample delay (USART_CTRL_SMSDELAY), which results in input data being sampled on the subsequent clock edge. In the
case of SPI mode 0 operation, as used here, input data is sampled not on the falling edge of the clock but on the next
rising edge of the clock.  This is perfectly allowable and expected because any modern SPI flash device is going to support
clock rates well in excess (100 MHz is not unusual) of the maximum 50 MHz read frequency supported by the original M25P40.
The slave device will not change the data it drives on its transmit output until this edge is received, at which point the
master will have already latched it.

The GPIO pins used by USART2 are configured, and the fastest possible slew rate is set so that the clock is a well-defined
square. Note that the USART RX, TX, and CLK pins all use the same GPIO port for this reason, although, technically the slew
rate setting applies only to CLK and TX, as these are outputs. Because the chip select (CS) is a manually controlled GPIO
and is not timing-critical, any GPIO pin can be used.

5.  The LDMA is initialized with one channel configured to transmit the outgoing data and another configured to receive the
incoming data.

Note that only BYTECOUNT bytes of data (1 Kbyte as defined) are transmitted/received at a time. While this is a synthetic
benchmark, the 1 Kbyte block size is a reasonable amount because the data has to be stored somewhere and processed given
the limited RAM available on the EFR32xG21.

6. The SYSTICK interrupt is enable and the start time is synchronized (saved  as soon as the SYSTICK counter is incremented).

7. The read sequence is started by asserting the SPI flash chip select (driving a GPIO low), sending the READ command, and
sending the 24-bit address.

8. The LDMA is started to transmit and receive 1024 bytes of data.

This is performed repeatedly in a for-loop that executes the specified number of times. A state variable, rxDone, is set to
false, and the device enters EM1. When the LDMA channel handling the receive data stream completes its transfer, the device
exits EM1, and the rxDone flag is set to true.   

9. The SYSTICK count is captured and its interrupt is disabled.

10. The data transfer rate is calculated and displayed along with the LDMA clock frequency.

## Porting to Another EFR32 Series 2 Device ##

Apart from any issues of pin availability on a given radio board, this code should run as-is on any radio board for EFR32xG21
or any module that is based on EFR32xG21, such as BGM210L, BGM210P, MGM210L, and MGM210P.

The code can also run on EFR32xG22, although this has not been tested. However, all module clocks � GPIO, LDMA, and USART2
(retargetio.enables the clock for whatever USART it is configured to use, which is USART0 in this case) � because xG22
does not have the on-demand module clock enable functionality that is present on xG21.

search box and locate the desired radio board, then click Apply to change the project settings, and go from there.
